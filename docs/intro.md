# Introduction

The XAIN project is building a GDPR-compliance layer for machine learning. The
approach relies on federated machine learning (FedML) as enabling technology
that removes compliance-related adoption barriers of AI applications used in
production.

At present, the source code in this project demonstrates the effectiveness of
our FedML implementation on well known benchmarks using a realistic deep
learning model structure. We will soon add a link to details on those
experiments.

In the future, we will open source here a first minimal viable product for this
layer. And we will add links to articles and papers that describe our
approaches to networking, architecture, and privacy-preserving technology. We
will also provide references to legal opinions about how and why our compliance
layer for machine learning meets the demands of GDPR.

POLITE NOTE: We want to point out that running the benchmarks as described
below is consuming considerable resources. XAIN cannot take any
responsibilities for costs that arise for you when you execute these demanding
machine-learning benchmarks.
